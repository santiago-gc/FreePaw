FreePaw - App for walking dogs

Working principle:

• The customer shares his location and then requests the service for a slected time period and fare.

• The service request is visible to the dog walker, if he accepts it, a confirmation is sent to the customer, who can check the dog walker location via GPS.

• The dog walker reaches the customer's location to pick up the dog.

• The dog walker turns the dog to its original location once the service is over.

• The customer must confirm that the dog has been returned to the agreed location in order to terminate the service.
